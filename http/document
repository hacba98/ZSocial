=== SOME NOTES ABOUT HTTP SERVER USED ===
1. How we implemented the web server?
- We used Poco::Net::HTTPServer as a subsystem in our main application

2. What are differences between HTTP Connection and TCP Connection?
a. What is keep alive HTTP connection (persistent TCP connection)?
- HTTP connection by default will close after one request, with keep alive connection will reduce open connection job
- Need to set keep alive header in client side
- Need to set true _keepAlive in HTTP Params server side

3. What differences between HTTPServerParams vs TCPServerParams?
a. Main ideas:
- TCPServerParams using to config the under layer of connection handler, meaning config for multi clients
- HTTPServerParams focus only to one single client

b. Params:
- TCPServerParams: control the thread pool for handling request from client
	+ threadIdletime : thread waitting time b4 destroyed
	+ maxQueue: maximum waiting queue for coming request, extended connections will be discards.
	(làm s để nó ko discard when reaching max size)
	+ maxThread: maximum simultaneous running threads for dispatcher request
	(số lượng request được xử lý một lúc) (cái pool được sử dụng phải đảm bảo được lượng capacity tương ứng)
- HTTPServerParams: control the connection of one client, and setting keepAlive connection
	+ timeout: timeout for one connection
	+ keepAlive: for keepAlive connection
	+ maxKeepAlive: for maximum request send per keep-alive connection -> reaching max will close connection
	+ keepAliveTimeout: connection timout for HTTP connections
